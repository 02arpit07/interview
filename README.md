## Simple Sorting

### Bubble Sort

[Implementation](https://github.com/donbeave/interview/blob/master/src/main/java/com/zhokhov/interview/sorting/BubbleSort.java)

The bubble sort is notoriously slow, but it’s conceptually the simplest of the sorting algorithms.

Sorting process:

1. Compare two items.
2. If the one on the left is bigger, swap them.
3. Move one position right.

##### Efficiency

For `10` data items, this is `45` comparisons (`9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1`).

In general, where `N` is the number of items in the array, there are `N-1` comparisons on the first pass, `N-2` on the second, and so on. The formula for the sum of such a series is
`(N–1) + (N–2) + (N–3) + ... + 1 = N*(N–1)/2 N*(N–1)/2 is 45 (10*9/2)` when `N` is `10`.


### Selection Sort

[Implementation](https://github.com/donbeave/interview/blob/master/src/main/java/com/zhokhov/interview/sorting/SelectionSort.java)

The selection sort improves on the bubble sort by reducing the number of swaps necessary from `O(N2)` to `O(N)`. Unfortunately, the number of comparisons remains `O(N2)`. However, the selection sort can still offer a significant improvement for large records that must be physically moved around in memory, causing the swap time to be much more important than the comparison time.

##### Efficiency

The selection sort performs the same number of comparisons as the bubble sort: `N*(N-1)/2`. For `10` data items, this is `45` comparisons. However, `10` items require fewer than `10` swaps. With `100` items, `4,950` comparisons are required, but fewer than `100` swaps. For large values of `N`, the comparison times will dominate, so we would have to say that the selection sort runs in `O(N2)` time, just as the bubble sort did.
